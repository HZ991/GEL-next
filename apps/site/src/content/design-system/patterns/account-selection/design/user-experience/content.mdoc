Account information can be laid out differently, depending on where you are in the application. Each account can contain the following elements:

- **Account name**&nbsp;- By default, this is the product name. However, if the customer has created a nickname for the account, it may be shown instead.
- **Account number**&nbsp;- The BSB, account number or card number is displayed depending on the product type.
- **Balance**&nbsp;- The balance of the account is usually the most prominent detail.
- **Available balance**&nbsp;- The available balance is shown when there is a difference between a customer's current and available balance.

Using the nickname when itâ€™s available helps the customer recognise which account is being shown - if the customer has multiple accounts of the same type, this makes it easier to distinguish them.

The visual hierarchy of the information ensures the most important detail is easily found.
