### Limitations

As credit score criteria is often based off existing external agency databases and data sets (most likely derived from ABS sources), this limits the amount of influence we can have in creating this pattern from a ‘best practise’ approach.

In particular, the data sets provided for Occupation category and Occupation don’t marry up with modern interpretations of vocation with many increasingly common titles absent.
