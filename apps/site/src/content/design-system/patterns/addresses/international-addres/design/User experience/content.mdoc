When trying to accommodate very broad data sets, you can end up with very long lists of items to choose from. One way this pattern tries to assist users when entering this data is by providing an auto-complete for country selection, this saves them from having to scroll or swipe through a long list of countries.

### Selects

Auto-complete is not always technically possible, in these situation using selects can provide more accurate results but can also be unwieldy on mobile, and difficult for those with motor or cognitive deficiencies. It is best practise not to use select boxes with lengthy data sets as forcing users to scroll through long lists of data to find their country can be frustrating.

One way of limiting the issue of a long list is to show the most common responses at the top (in this case it’s countries) so the majority of your audience doesn’t need to scroll.
