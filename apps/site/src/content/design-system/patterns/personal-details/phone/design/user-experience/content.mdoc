In order to maximise data capture and keep your form lean, only select the phone number types necessary for compliance, and preferably only one such as mobile (keeping in mind not every customer will own a mobile phone).

These components are purposefully kept simple to satisfy accessibility requirements as well as reduce complexity and ambiguity which comes with shoehorning multiple choices into one field.

**Why not field masking?** Field masking separates numerical inputs according to a predetermined format to match the real world reference. While this is a good heuristic to abide by, in this instance it causes issues with assistive technologies making playback nonsensical, and thus should be avoided.

**Use hint text** If there is a specific format required such as an area code, use hint text to communicate this. The back end systems should accept numbers with spaces or without spaces.
