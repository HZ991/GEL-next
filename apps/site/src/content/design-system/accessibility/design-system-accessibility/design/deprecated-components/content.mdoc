Unfortunately a few of the components from the previous version of the Design System no longer made the grade in the new WCAG 2.1 AA world. So they had to be deprecated or significantly adjusted, this is what has changed:

- Removed the functionality to dismiss a popover by clicking anywhere else on the page. We still have the [Popover](/design-system/components/popover) with toggle functionality. To continue to comply with accessibility requirements Popovers need to be dismissed by either clicking on the trigger that launched them or by selecting a close button.
- Labels were removed from Switches ([Switches](/design-system/components/switch) without labels are still available). The labels, On/Off were removed as they posed an accessibility issue for screen readers. In code, a switch is just a checkbox, a checkbox doesn't have a label that describes if it is checked or not. Re-engineering the switch to include that label was not worth the complexity required.
- Tooltips proved to have accessibility issues as well as not working effectively across responsive applications. As they were not very widely used (if at all) they were removed.
