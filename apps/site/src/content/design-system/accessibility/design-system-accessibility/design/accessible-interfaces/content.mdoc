When designing and coding for accessibility, it's often the case of function over form to ensure components meet WCAG standards while still retaining a layer of branded attributes and market appeal.

Consideration for assistive technologies for digital goes beyond screen readers, we also design for those with motor skill challenges, cognitive challenges and impaired sight to name a few.

Colour contrast, line weights, hit targets and spacing are all considered when designing the visual aspects of the components, while making sure the integrity of each brand in the Westpac Group is protected.
