This is the aspect of accessibility that seems to have the most awareness, where the code is tested before delivery of the product or service. If you've got all other aspects of your inclusive design right, then this is the next most important part of the process. Ensuring that the code is accessible is what allows users to consume your content using the assistive technologies they depend on, like screen readers.

This is one of the driving forces behind the GEL Design System, it is a systematic framework for building accessible and inclusive products and services.

All components have been thoroughly tested for accessibility and comply with WGAC 2.1 AA. Each component has been tested in isolation, so when teams are building new products using these components, it is still a requirement to test the built product or service before going live. However, if it has been assembled using components from the Design System, you'll already be ahead.

We have close, established relationships with industry leading accessibility experts and continue to push boundaries to deliver ever-accessible components and patterns. The following describes how our components were tested:

### Testing approach

Every component has been tested and passed relevant WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA Success Criteria for mobile and desktop views. The testing was conducted across 7 combinations of assistive technology and web browsers based on the most commonly used assistive technology and web browser combinations on PC, Mac, iOS and Android including:

- JAWS 17 and JAWS 2019 with Internet Explorer 11 on Windows
- NVDA (latest) with Firefox (latest) on Windows
- VoiceOver with Safari on OSX
- VoiceOver with Safari on iOS (latest)
- TalkBack with Chrome on Android (latest)
- Dragon NaturallySpeaking with Internet Explorer 11 on Windows

Any WCAG conformance issues, assistive technology issues found were workshopped and addressed using best practice approaches and recommendations for creating a more inclusive experience.
