As well as offering simple products, we need to ensure we communicate their specifics in a clear and inclusive way. Complicated terminology can be appropriate for a certain audience, especially when talking about products and services that are specific to customers in more specialised fields. But in general our products and services are for the whole community, so we should ensure that content is easily readable, and if there are situations where that is not possible then we need to use supplemental content to clarify it. According to WCAG ‘Supplemental content is required when text demands reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level—that is, more than nine years of school.’

The most common form of supplemental content in a digital context would be the ‘Help text’ you find associated with forms and calculators.
