### **Brand fonts**

Check the [Masterbrand Guidelines](https://westpacgroup.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/O365-UG-031831-GELOperatingEnvironmenttest/EnwmDFymE-dDtefynPcIwn4BdmYcqLZ2_ia2qdR6_YJcqA?e=rc10CQ) to understand how to use brand fonts effectively. Never use a font without confirmation that you have the correct licence in place.

Designers using other software can send a request for approval to [brand@westpac.com.au](mailto:brand@westpac.com.au).
