Since the inception of the internet, links have been integral for navigation, and still are to this day. They are defined by underlines, an established convention that is instantly recognisable. Any deviations need another strong signifier such as an icon to avoid impacts to usability, optimisation, and accessibility.

By establishing consistency across all web interfaces and across all brands we are optimising the experience for customers and meeting the highest accessible standards. If you’re unsure if a link is accessible, consult an accessibility manager to explain the use case and context.

Standalone links produce an underline for the text on hover while inline links remove the underline on hover. These small degrees of interaction assist those with motor and cognitive challenges to identify when they’ve interacted with the link.

### Link lists

The most accessible way to present a list of links is to use the [List component](/components/lists). It can be configured as a list of links which is better for screen reader users to navigate.
