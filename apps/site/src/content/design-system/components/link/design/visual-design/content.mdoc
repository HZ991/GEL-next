The standalone link uses a "Link" colour for the icon and "Text" colour for the text. In testing, using the "Link" colour for the text became overwhelming on a page which may contain many links.

The inline link uses a "Link" colour for the text and if using an icon, it too uses the "Link" colour.

### Exceptions

There are exceptions to using underlines and these use cases require an accessibility manager to review and approve. Examples are menus, header or footer navigation, or other lists which could be interpreted as a menu in page.
