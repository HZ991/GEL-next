The standalone link uses a Primary colour for the icon and Text colour for the text. In testing, using the Primary colour for the text became overwhelming on a page which may contain many links.

The inline link uses a Primary colour for the text and if using an icon, it too uses the Primary colour.

For both link types the icon can be used at different sizes but to keep interfaces consistent always defer to the default.

### Exceptions

There are exceptions to using underlines and these use cases require an accessibility manager to review and approve. Examples are menus, header or footer navigation, or other lists which could be interpreted as a menu in page.
