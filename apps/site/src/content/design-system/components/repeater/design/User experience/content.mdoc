The text “Add new” is configurable but must be used with the “Add Circle” icon in order to be discoverable and appear as an affordance.

A remove button appears once another instance has been added and is positioned in line with the top of the instance in question.

The “Add new” button must always be left aligned in order to maximise discoverability.
