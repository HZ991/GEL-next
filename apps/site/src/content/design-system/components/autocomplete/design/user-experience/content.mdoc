Using an Autocomplete field can streamline and accelerate the process of inputting information. As the user starts typing, a filtered list of options appears, based on the characters they have entered. It can be very useful in scenarios where the list of possible options is very long, and the user already knows the answer they are looking for. When used correctly, this component helps make selections more efficiently, reduces typos and generally improves the user experience.&nbsp;

We suggest using the word *Search* somewhere in the hint text label, this, along with the Search icon, this sets the expectation of search-oriented functionality rather than a simple text input.
