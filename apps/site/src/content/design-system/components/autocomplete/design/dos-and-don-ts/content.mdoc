- Do use the Autocomplete field in scenarios where the user will already know the option they need to search for and select, e.g., their address or&nbsp;a country, etc. &nbsp;
- Avoid using Autocomplete if the user needs to see the entire list of options before they can select, e.g., a list of Product specific options.&nbsp;
