The default panel uses colour in the header to increase visibility and branding. This can be useful in text heavy screens where areas of colour can provide some relief. As the name suggests the faint panel can be used for content that doesn't need to be visually prominent. Like most of the UI components the faint panel is designed to be subtle and unobtrusive so as not to detract from the content.
