Panels are designed to group content either for visual structure or as a design requirement. They have optional headers and footers which can be used to associate actions with your grouped content. Panels can be grouped forming a [tabcordion](/design-system/components/tabcordions), or can be stripped back visually and functionally as a [well](/design-system/components/wells) for a more subtle content experience.
