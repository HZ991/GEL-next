Wells have been designed to use responsive padding. As the viewport increases so too does the padding. This reduces long line widths and creates a more considered layout across all viewports.

A simple approach to make content stand out is to contrast the colour of your well with the background colour of the page. A white well on background colour, or vice versa, will highlight your content in a subtle yet effective way.
