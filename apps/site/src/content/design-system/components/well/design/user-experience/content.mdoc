Wells are used to group and separate content, they are a consciously simple component, with the purpose of showcasing the content they contain. They're often used for secondary legal information e.g. terms and conditions, things you should know etc.

If you need to associate an action with the content in your well then you could try using a [panel](/design-system/components/panels) component, which includes an optional header and/or footer, for this purpose.
