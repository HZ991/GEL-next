All components comply with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines and Success Criteria. These fall under the [four principles of accessibility](/design-system/accessibility/design-system-accessibility) â€“ Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust. Below are some specific ways in which this component follows these principles:

### Robust

When designing inputs with select boxes (eg input with timeframe selection), the select box is often placed to the right of the input. This makes most sense for sighted users and plays to convention.

However, it makes the order of inputs announced by screen readers as 1. input 2. select. This means screen reader users will be unaware of the ability to change the timeframe until the select box receives focus and is announced, potentially forcing them to reconsider their input, delete, then re-enter.

One way to aid screen reader users is to use hint text to instruct. For example:

"Enter the amount and select day, month, or year"
