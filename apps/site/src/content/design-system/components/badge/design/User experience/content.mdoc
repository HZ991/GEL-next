**Default style** badges are designed to highlight a word. The commonly seen usage is when indicating a function or feature in an application that is new or when onboarding.

**Pill style** badges are designed to highlight a number. The most common usage is to indicate the number of unread emails or messages that need to be addressed.

Badges are most effective at drawing attention when they appear and disappear as needed, or when the number they are highlighting changes. For example, in the ‘Unread emails’ scenario, when all the emails have been read the badge should no longer be visible. Or when being used to indicate a new feature, the label should hide once the feature is no longer new. This behaviour helps make them more prominent to a user when they do appear.

Used incorrectly or too often runs the risk that future uses of badges will be ignored.
