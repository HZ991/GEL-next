Be careful not to hide important information inside a Collapsible. There is a temptation to use it as a “dirty closet” to keep your page free of clutter or “minimalist”, however this approach ignores the task based scenarios of users who are attempting to accomplish something and could reduce the efficacy of your design.

Pay particular attention to content which may be important product information or deemed legal compliance, and always check with Risk and Compliance.
