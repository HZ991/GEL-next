- The user interacts with the button to toggle the collapsible content area – consistently whether using mouse, touch or keyboard. To hide the panel the user may toggle the button again.
- As with similar components that hide/show content, this component follows a ‘user is in control’ approach. Rather than programmatically moving focus to the collapsible content when shown, the toggle button has an *aria-expanded* attribute; the assistive technology user can choose to ‘arrow down’ to announce the collapsible content if they wish.
- An indicator outline appears around the button toggle when focused
- The toggle button shape, text, icon and collapsible content is visible in Windows High Contrast Mode
