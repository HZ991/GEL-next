- `role="list"`: Lists with custom bullets have a “list” _role_ because removing standard bullet styling affects how VoiceOver announced lists (see [VoiceOver and list-style-type: none](https://unfetteredthoughts.net/2017/09/26/voiceover-and-list-style-type-none/))
- `<span aria-label="{DESCRIPTION}">`: Provides a label that describes the Icon
- `<svg role="img" focusable="false">`: Prevents the Icon SVG element from being traversed by browsers that map the SVG to the ‘group’ role and from unnecessarily receiving focus in Internet Explorer (IE)
