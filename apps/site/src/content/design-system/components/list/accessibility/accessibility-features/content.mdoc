- Lists are announced as expected in all screen readers including VoiceOver
- Custom bullet shapes (incl. chevrons, ticks and crosses) are rendered using CSS borders and are visible in Windows High Contrast Mode (WHCM), ‘look’ styling (colour) is not retained in WHCM.

### Accessibility in the HTML

- `role="list"`: Lists with custom bullets have a “list” *role* because removing standard bullet styling affects how VoiceOver announced lists (see [VoiceOver and list-style-type: none](https://unfetteredthoughts.net/2017/09/26/voiceover-and-list-style-type-none/))
- `<span aria-label="{DESCRIPTION}">`: Provides a label that describes the Icon
- `<svg role="img" focusable="false">`: Prevents the Icon SVG element from being traversed by browsers that map the SVG to the ‘group’ role and from unnecessarily receiving focus in Internet Explorer (IE)
