- `<input type="radio|checkbox" aria-describedby="{HINT_ID}" id="{OPTION_ID}" name="{NAME}">`: Checkbox and Radio Selectors: each item option is defined as a radio or checkbox *input* and must have a unique *id* value. A consistent *name* attribute value is required for radio inputs for toggling to operate correctly. [React component: *id* is auto-generated]
- `<label for="{OPTION_ID}">`: Each radio or checkbox *input* has a *label* element and uses explicit association (connected to the input using a *for* attribute) for optimal support in assistive technologies. [React component: *for* is auto-generated]
- `<div id="{HINT_ID}">`: Hint text element must have a unique *id* value. The *input* element *aria-describedby* and hint text element *id* attribute values must match.
- `<div aria-hidden="true">`: Indicator check/tick and next icons are hidden from assistive technologies; any selected/checked state is provided by the input
- `<button aria-pressed="false|true">`: Button Selector: state is provided with *aria-pressed* attribute. Note: Button (and Link) Selector hint text is not associated as with Checkbox and Radio Selector; hint text is announced as standard button (or link) text.
- `<span aria-hidden="true">`: Hides icon or pictogram SVGs from assistive technologies; they are visual embellishment
