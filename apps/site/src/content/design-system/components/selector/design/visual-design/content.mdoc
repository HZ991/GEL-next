The selector border radius needs to be accessible and so uses the Border Dark colour which meets WCAGâ€™s contrast ratio requirements. When selected, the border thickens to 3px as well as taking on the Hero colour to make it clear it has been selected.

The labels inside and hint text follow the established sizing and weight conventions we use in all our form controls.

While [icons](/foundation/icons) and [pictograms](/foundation/pictograms) can be used, be careful not to rely on them to convey the primary meaning of the content. They are available to be used as a supplementary visual cue. Be aware with pictograms that at small sizes they lose some of their detail and in turn their effectiveness as a communication device.

When the selector is used with the chevron, on desktop devices it will produce a micro-interaction on hover by shifting 10px to the right. This helps inform users that when selected, they will navigate to another page or screen, matching the established convention in all Westpac Group brands.
