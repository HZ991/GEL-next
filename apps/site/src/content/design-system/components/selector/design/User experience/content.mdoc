The Selector is a component for helping users make a choice about a product, usually at the acquisition stage, or at the service end as the large container helps distinguish it from a form control (despite it being a big radio or checkbox!).

In order to be accessible, [radios](/design-system/components/radios) and [checkboxes](/design-system/components/checkboxes) need a fieldset legend—essentially a descriptive label above the choices that gives context to the options presented which is also beneficial from a usability standpoint.

As the Selector can be used as a radio or checkbox, we strongly recommend making that distinction in the label. Eg, “Select one account below” or “Select all accounts below that apply”.

Note, the label is not part of the Selector and will have to be designed and integrated.

When using hint text, bear in mind how much copy you use as this impacts the way the selector appears on mobile. Hint text should aid in the decision or provide greater context rather than tell a story.
