Most operating systems provide default styling for common UI elements such as radio groups. We've overridden this default styling for several reasons:

1. The default styling does not align with our brands look and feel.
1. The default styling often fails accessibility requirements such as colour contrast ratio and hit area.
1. The default styling is proportionately not aligned with the other UI elements.

These issues have been addressed with the styling of the radio groups while making them more accessible, more consistent, more tactile and more visually appealing. These overrides also ensure that the radio components will adapt automatically when building multi-brand applications.
