The radio component has the ability to hide a configurable portion of the options presented to the user. This is useful for when business requirements dictate that long lists of options must be presented to the customer.

*   Avoid hiding one or two options under the toggle as this forces the user to interact with the interface for very little value.
*   Use data to inform your decisions on which options are surfaced at the screen level.
*   Surface the most popular and hide the rest behind the interaction.
*   Always express how many items are behind the reveal.
