- `<input type="radio" id="{OPTION_ID}" name="{NAME}">`: Each item option is defined as a radio *input* and must have a unique *id* value. A consistent *name* attribute value is required on all inputs for toggling to operate correctly. [React component: *id* is auto-generated]
- `<label for="{OPTION_ID}">`: Each radio *input* has a *label* element and uses explicit association (connected to the input using a *for* attribute) for optimal support in assistive technologies. [React component: *for* is auto-generated]
- `<button aria-expanded="true|false" aria-hidden="true|false">`: Radio with reveal toggle button uses the *aria-expanded* attribute to indicate collapse state and *aria-hidden* attribute to hide from assistive technologies when no longer available
- `<div aria-hidden="true|false">`: Reveal radio options are wrapped in an element with *aria-hidden* attribute to hide from assistive technologies when no longer available
