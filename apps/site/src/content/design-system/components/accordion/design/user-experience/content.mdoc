The accordion component has two modes:

1. **Accordion**&nbsp;– collapsible content containers, allowing multiple content panels to be visible simultaneously, by selecting the relevant bar.
1. **Tabcordion**&nbsp;– a responsive combination of accordions and Tabs.

‘Tabcordion’ is the term we use to describe responsive tabs. When using a Tabs in our web applications we typically experience layout issues when the application needs to display on small viewports (phones). Often the tabs won’t fit horizontally in the limited screen size. To remedy this problem, we developed the Tabcordion where the Tabs will turn into an Accordion when viewed on smaller devices (phones).

This component is useful when trying to simplify and group content for users to view when they need it, as opposed to displaying everything at once.
