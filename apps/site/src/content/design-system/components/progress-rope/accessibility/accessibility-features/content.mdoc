- The set of step buttons is structured using an ordered list
- A `<nav>` element labeled “In this form” identifies the structure as a navigation menu and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate
- Step button and Group toggle button text is appended with visually hidden text to convey the step’s state: ‘in progress’, ‘complete’ and ‘not stated’ e.g. “Step 1, complete”, “Step 2, in progress” and ”Step 3, not started”
- Group toggle buttons are wrapped with a heading element to provide a navigation landmark
