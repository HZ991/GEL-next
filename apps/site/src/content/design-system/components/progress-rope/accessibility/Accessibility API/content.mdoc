*   `<nav role="navigation" aria-label="In this form">`: Provides a label that describes the type of navigation

The list has a “list” _role_ because removing standard bullet styling affects how VoiceOver announces lists (see [VoiceOver and list-style-type: noneCopyright © 2023 by Westpac Banking Corporation.

*   `<button aria-current="page">`: Applied to the current step button to indicate that it represents the current page
*   `<button aria-expanded="true|false" aria-controls="{ID}">`: Identifies a button element that toggles a content collapse and indicates the state of a collapsible element below. The _aria-controls_ attribute creates an association between toggle button and collapsible element.
*   `<ol role="list" id="{ID}" aria-hidden="true|false">`: The collapsible element must have a unique _id_ value. The toggle button _aria-controls_ and collapsible element _id_ attribute values must match. The collapsible element uses the _aria-hidden_ attribute to hide from assistive technologies when no longer available.
