- `<nav role="navigation" aria-label="In this form">`: Provides a label that describes the type of navigation
- `<ol role="list">`: Step buttons are within an ordered list to provide additional semantic meaning. The list has a “list” *role* because removing standard bullet styling affects how VoiceOver announces lists (see [VoiceOver and list-style-type: none](https://unfetteredthoughts.net/2017/09/26/voiceover-and-list-style-type-none/)).
- `<button aria-current="page">`: Applied to the current step button to indicate that it represents the current page
- `<button aria-expanded="true|false" aria-controls="{ID}">`: Identifies a button element that toggles a content collapse and indicates the state of a collapsible element below. The *aria-controls* attribute creates an association between toggle button and collapsible element.
- `<ol role="list" id="{ID}" aria-hidden="true|false">`: The collapsible element must have a unique *id* value. The toggle button *aria-controls* and collapsible element *id* attribute values must match. The collapsible element uses the *aria-hidden* attribute to hide from assistive technologies when no longer available.
