All components comply with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines and Success Criteria. These fall under the [four principles of accessibility](/design-system/wbc/accessibility/design-system-accessibility) â€“ Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust. Below are some specific ways in which this component follows these principles:

### Perceivable

Our popover is user dismissed, the user selects the button, the dialog pops up and stays in its active state until the user dismisses it via the cross hair or by selecting the button again. This functionality has been chosen for usability and accessibility reasons, the user may wish to reference the information in the popover while performing another function e.g filling out a form field - which is not possible in the case of an auto-dismissed popover.
