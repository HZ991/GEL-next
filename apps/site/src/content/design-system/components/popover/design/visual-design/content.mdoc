Popovers are designed to be small overlays of content housing secondary information. They are often used to elaborate on terms or provide additional information/explanation to labels etc. Given that most of our interfaces are content heavy popovers have been designed to clearly stand out above the underlying content as a result they are intentionally more pronounced than most UI elements in the GUI.
