*   `<button>` / `<a>`: Identifies the element as a button (or link) element. Accessible name for the button is defined by the elementâ€™s text content. \[React component: refer to _tag_ prop\]
*   `<a href="{URL}">`: Links styled to look like buttons must include an _href_. \[React component: refer to _tag prop_ and _href_ attribute\]
*   `<button aria-label="{BUTTON_LABEL}">`: Optionally use _aria-label_ attribute to set a custom label (if different to the button text). The overall meaning of the _aria-label_ must be consistent with the visual button text to ensure an optimal experience for speech recognition software users (i.e. Dragon NaturallySpeaking). \[React component: refer to _assistiveText_ prop\]
*   `<span aria-hidden="true">`: Button icon elements have _aria-hidden="false"_ to hide them from assistive technologies; they are visual embellishment. Generally the button text provides the button description, if this is not the case a custom label can be used which will be announced instead of the button text for screen reader users. \[React component: refer to _iconBefore_, _iconAfter_ and _assistiveText_ props)
