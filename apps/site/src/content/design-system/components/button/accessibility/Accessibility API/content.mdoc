- `<button>` / `<a>`: Identifies the element as a button (or link) element. Accessible name for the button is defined by the elementâ€™s text content. [React component: refer to *tag* prop]
- `<a href="{URL}">`: Links styled to look like buttons must include an *href*. [React component: refer to *tag prop* and *href* attribute]
- `<button aria-label="{BUTTON_LABEL}">`: Optionally use *aria-label* attribute to set a custom label (if different to the button text). The overall meaning of the *aria-label* must be consistent with the visual button text to ensure an optimal experience for speech recognition software users (i.e. Dragon NaturallySpeaking). [React component: refer to *assistiveText* prop]
- `<span aria-hidden="true">`: Button icon elements have *aria-hidden="false"* to hide them from assistive technologies; they are visual embellishment. Generally the button text provides the button description, if this is not the case a custom label can be used which will be announced instead of the button text for screen reader users. [React component: refer to *iconBefore*, *iconAfter* and *assistiveText* props)
