The button system gives you the flexibility to choose from multiple styles, sizes and configurations depending on your needs. The system uses the brand colour palette to establish a consistent, logical hierarchy. This is particularly useful when the interface contains several actions which may vary in importance. From a visual design perspective buttons add clear delineation which aids legibility when the interface becomes complex or content heavy. Buttons also provide an opportunity to add some colour to the interface increasing brand recognition and freshening the overall look. Buttons are rectangular as opposed to lozenge in order to maximise the available width. This provides more flexibility with labels and button widths.
