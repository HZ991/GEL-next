- A `<svg>` element labeled with a description identifies the Symbol
- The Symbol shape is visible in Windows High Contrast Mode
- When using alongside descriptive visual text ensure `aria-hidden="true"` is used to hide the Symbol from assistive technologies, otherwise users will receive duplicate descriptions

### Accessibility in the HTML

- `<svg aria-label="{DESCRIPTION}">`: Provides a label that describes the Symbol
- `<svg role="img" focusable="false">`: Prevents the Symbol SVG element from being traversed by browsers that map the SVG to the ‘group’ role and from unnecessarily receiving focus in Internet Explorer (IE)
