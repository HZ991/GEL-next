Each symbol in the library has been carefully crafted (where possible aligning with the pixel grid), optimised and converted to SVG format, which:

- Ensures that the graphic can be resized to any dimension with no loss of quality
- Ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices
- Allows us to style the symbols using code
- Complies with AA accessibility requirements

These symbols are updated when the 3rd party refreshes their brand or adds more sub brands.
