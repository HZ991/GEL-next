Input groups are a great addition to fields in forms and calculators, they give immediate affordance informing the user what is required of them. Use input groups when thereâ€™s an association between one attribute and another, as they add a clear affordance for what type of data is required to be entered in the field, e.g. $ or %. You can also use an input group add-on at either end of a field related to a question eg an amount or time frame. For example, a numerical value and a time value ($2200 / month), or a currency and numerical value (AUD / $2200).
