### Add-ons

Add-ons are a great addition to fields in forms and calculators, they provide instant cues that inform users about what is expected of them. Use text add-ons when thereâ€™s an association between one attribute and another, as they add a clear affordance for what type of data is required to be entered in the field, e.g. $ or %.

You can also use a select add-on at either end of a field to combine two related questions e.g., an amount and a time frame ($2200 / month), or a currency type and a value (AUD / $2200).

### Supporting text

The most common usage of Supporting text is to display a character count for a field entry, this can be very useful to help manage users expectations around how much space is available for their message. It provides visual clarity and for users who may have cognitive or visual impairments, a character count can serve as an accessibility aid, helping them understand the input constraints more easily.
