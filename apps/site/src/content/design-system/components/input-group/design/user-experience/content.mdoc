### Add-ons

Add-ons are a great addition to fields in forms and calculators, they provide instant cues that inform users about what is expected of them. Use text add-ons when thereâ€™s an association between one attribute and another, as they add a clear affordance for what type of data is required to be entered in the field, e.g. $ or %.
