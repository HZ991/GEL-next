- Indicator outline appears around the input and button elements when focused
- Text input and select elements include a visually hidden label
- The input group shape and text content is visible in Windows High Contrast Mode (WHCM). Button ‘look’ styling (colour) is not visible in WHCM.

### Accessibility in the HTML

- `<label for="{ID}">`: Each text input or select element has a visually hidden *label* element and uses explicit association (connected to the text input or select element using a *for* attribute) for optimal support in assistive technologies. [React component: refer to *label* prop to set label text, *for* is auto-generated]
- `<input type="text" id="{ID}">` / `<select id="{ID}">`: Text input or select elements must have a unique *id* value. [React component: *id* is auto-generated]
