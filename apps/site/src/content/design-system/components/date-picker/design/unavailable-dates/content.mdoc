When dates are unavailable for whatever reason, the strikethrough styling is applied. This can be for the following scenarios:

- Any one date
- Any consecutive dates
- Any multiple dates (consecutive or otherwise)
- Specific days of the week (eg Wednesdays) and/or weekends.

```jsx
<Fragment>
  <ComponentTitle>Blocked out dates</ComponentTitle>
  <Field label="Select date">
    <DatePicker disableWeekends />
  </Field>
</Fragment>
```
