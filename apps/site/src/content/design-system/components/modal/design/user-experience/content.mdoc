A modal is useful for bringing information to the attention of a user and are best used for short decision making moments. As they can greatly disrupt the task or goal the user is attempting to complete, ensure modals are used sparingly and with good reason. Ensure calls to action are clear and users can escape the modal either by tapping or selecting outside the modal area by an obvious crosshair, and/or a close or cancel button.
