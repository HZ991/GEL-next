- `<div aria-modal="true" aria-hidden="{true|false}">`: Tells assistive technologies that the windows underneath the current dialog are not available for interaction (inert) and *aria-hidden* ensures the modal is hidden from assistive technologies as required. **Note: there is no** ***role="dialog"*** **attribute**. This is intentional as many screen readers will announce all modal content on open if this role is used. Our approach is to simply announce the heading and let the user be in control (as mentioned above).
- `<h1 tabindex="-1">`: Modal heading has a *tabindex* attribute, enabling the heading to receive focus (programmatically). The heading is announced on open. The *tabindex* value uses *-1* (rather than *0*) because we don’t need the heading focusable during normal keyboard navigation.
- `<button aria-label="Close modal">`: Close button announced as “Close modal” in screen readers
