- To make the content easier to read when displayed on small screens, the modal fills 100% of the screen. Completely covering the background window also hides background movement that occurs on some mobile devices when scrolling content inside the dialog.
- Modal heading receives focus and is announced on open. The user is able to ‘arrow down’ to navigate the modal content if desired. This pattern differs from the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Modal Dialog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html) pattern, which announces all modal content on open and is often considered unnecessarily verbose for screen reader users.
- Close button appears below the heading in the source order; users can easily ‘arrow down’ and close the modal if the heading content was of no interest
- When the modal is open, focus is constrained within the context of the modal. Sequential keyboard navigation loops through focusable elements within the modal; and not to any elements found outside of the modal.
- Close the modal using Close button, Esc key or background click (if modal is dismissible)
- When the modal closes, focus returns to the button that originally toggled the modal
- The modal shape, text and icon content is visible in Windows High Contrast Mode (WHCM). Button ‘look’ styling (colour) is not visible in WHCM.
