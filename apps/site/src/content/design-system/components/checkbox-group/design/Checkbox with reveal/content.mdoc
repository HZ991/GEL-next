When requirements dictate long lists of choices, and particularly as mobile screens can only show a limited amount of information at a time, it's possible to surface the most common choices, and hide the rest under a "reveal" interaction. Once the user selects the toggle, the remaining items reveal and the toggle disappears.

*   Avoid hiding one or two options under the toggle as this forces the user to interact with the interface for very little value.
*   Use data to inform your decisions on which options are surfaced at the screen level.
*   Surface the most popular and hide the rest behind the interaction.
*   Always express how many items are behind the reveal.
