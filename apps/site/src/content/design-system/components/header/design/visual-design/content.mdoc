The Header components is a basic, configurable component used to hold global elements such as logos and navigation. As with all the GEL UI components they are intentionally designed to be subtle and understated so as not to detract from the content. When the header is fixed a drop shadow is applied when content scrolls below the header.

The Header component is designed to be responsive and multi-brand. This ensures that all branding etc will automatically be the correct size and position when the brand is switched.
