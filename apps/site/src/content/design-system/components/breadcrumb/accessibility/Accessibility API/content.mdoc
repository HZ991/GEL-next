- `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">`: Provides a label that describes the type of navigation
- `<ol role="list">`: Links are within an ordered list to provide additional semantic meaning—crumbs are quantifiable and part of a hierarchy, each descendants of a higher-priority crumb. The list has a “list” *role* because removing standard bullet styling affects how VoiceOver announces lists (see [VoiceOver and list-style-type: none](https://unfetteredthoughts.net/2017/09/26/voiceover-and-list-style-type-none/)).
- `<a aria-current="page">`: Applied to the last link in the set to indicate that it represents the current page
- `<span aria-hidden="true">`: Hides the visual separator icon SVGs from assistive technologies; they are visual embellishment
