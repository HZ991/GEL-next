Use Block-level switches in small break points to align the label and element to either side of the screen. This behaviour can be set up to work responsively, and change depending on breakpoint. Use the 'Demo' button to see this component working responsively.

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-col">
  <Switch block label="eStatements" />
  <Switch block label="Quick balance" />
</div>
```
