Switches are used primarily as toggles for settings and are a strong metaphor for light switches, essentially they a simple Boolean, either on or off. As switches usually relate to task based interactions, the switch animation should be relatively fast. Be careful how you word the labels that accompany a switch, the label needs to be answered as On or Off, they do not reflect Yes or No. If you need an answer of Yes or No, you could use a [button group](/components/button-groups).
