Use fix width inputs to help indicate the length of the input required. For example, if you are asking for a Postcode use an input with a width of 4 (i.e. 4 characters), this type of affordance helps with scanning and supports quick and easy form completion.

```tsx

<Input
  placeholder="5"
  size="medium" width="5"
/>

```
