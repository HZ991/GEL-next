Use fix width inputs to help indicate the length of the data required. For example, if you are asking for a Postcode use an input with a width of 4 (i.e. 4 characters), this type of affordance helps with scanning and supports quick and easy form completion.

```tsx

<><Input  placeholder="placeholder"  size="medium" width="5"/><Input  placeholder="placeholder"  size="medium" width="6"/></>

```
