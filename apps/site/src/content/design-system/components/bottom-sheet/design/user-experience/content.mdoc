This component has been created as a web version of a UI element generally more associated with native experiences. ie iOS 'ActionSheet' and Andriod 'BottomSheet'. These native components are f mobile experiences only, as the Design System is responsive we needed a version that also had a state for when it is viewed on larger devices, where the bottom sheet interaction doesn't work as well.

It appears as an overlay and behaves in a similar way to a modal, they require the user to interact with them or dismiss them. They block any interaction with the background content while they are visible.
