This component was developed as a web version of a UI element typically associated with native experiences, such as iOS's 'ActionSheet' and Android's 'BottomSheet.' While these native components are designed for mobile experiences, our responsive Design System required a web version that could adapt for larger devices, where the bottom sheet interaction is less effective.

The Bottom sheet component appears as an overlay and behaves in a similar way to a modal, it requires the user to interact with it or dismiss it. It blocks any interaction with the background content while it is visible.
