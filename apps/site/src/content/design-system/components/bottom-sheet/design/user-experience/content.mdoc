This component was developed as a web version of a UI element typically associated with native experiences, such as iOS's 'ActionSheet' and Android's 'BottomSheet.' While these native components are designed for mobile experiences, our responsive Design System required a web version that could adapt for larger devices, where the bottom sheet interaction is less effective.

It appears as an overlay and behaves in a similar way to a modal, they require the user to interact with them or dismiss them. They block any interaction with the background content while they are visible.
