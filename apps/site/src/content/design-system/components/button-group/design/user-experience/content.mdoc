Button groups are a series of buttons grouped together on a single line to create a toggle. Behind the scenes in code, they work much the same way as radio buttons.

As button groups tend to break on small screen sizes especially when using more than two (see do's and don'ts) and when using long copy (the text wraps inside the button), it is recommended to use sparingly. If the label lengths are too long or there are too many choices, they become hard to scan, losing efficacy. Our eyes lose the shape of the words as they are housed in 'block containers', making it more difficult to distinguish each word/choice, slowing down the user and increasing their cognitive effort.

Consider the two-button button group when designing forms for questions with yes/no answers.

It's important to note that button groups differ from [switches](/components/switch).
