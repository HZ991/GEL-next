Using block level button groups will allow the button group to stretch the full width of it's container, which is useful for smaller viewports. Use the 'Demo' button to see how this component works responsively.

```jsx
<div className="grid gap-3">
  <ButtonGroup 
    label="How would you like to be contacted?"
    look="hero" 
    block
    buttons={[
      { value: "Email", label: "Email"}, 
      { value: "Phone", label: "Phone" },
      { value: "SMS", label: "SMS" }
    ]}
  />
</div>
```
