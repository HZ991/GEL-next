*   `<input type="radio" id="{OPTION_ID}" name="{NAME}">`: Each item option is defined as a (hidden) radio _input_ and must have a unique _id_ value. A consistent _name_ attribute value is required on all inputs for toggling to operate correctly. \[React component: refer to _name_ prop, _id_ is auto-generated\]
*   `<label for="{OPTION_ID}">`: Each radio _input_ is wrapped with a _label_ element and uses explicit association (connected to the input using a _for_ attribute) for optimal support in assistive technologies. \[React component: _for_ is auto-generated\]
