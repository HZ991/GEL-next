- `<input type="radio" id="{OPTION_ID}" name="{NAME}">`: Each item option is defined as a (hidden) radio *input* and must have a unique *id* value. A consistent *name* attribute value is required on all inputs for toggling to operate correctly. [React component: refer to *name* prop, *id* is auto-generated]
- `<label for="{OPTION_ID}">`: Each radio *input* is wrapped with a *label* element and uses explicit association (connected to the input using a *for* attribute) for optimal support in assistive technologies. [React component: *for* is auto-generated]
