The footer component is a basic, configurable component used to hold global elements such as Copyright information etc. As with all the GEL UI components they are intentionally designed to be subtle and understated so as not to detract from the content. We also use a “sticky” footer to ensure that that this component never moves above the base of the viewport.

The footer component is designed to be responsive and multi-brand. This ensures that all branding etc will automatically be the correct size and position when the brand is switched.
