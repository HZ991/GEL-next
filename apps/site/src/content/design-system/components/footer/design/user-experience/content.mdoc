Footers are like an anchor which signifies the end of a page or screen. They are also used as a secondary or tertiary navigation for many users. Often links to service, contact, or other overarching information is found in the footer.

In forms, the footer is simplified to show the secure environment in which the user is in, as well as any legal obligations. The security icon is a visual cue which signifies the secure environment and shouldnâ€™t be removed.

### Copy in footers

All footer copy should be considered at the design stage in consultation with legal teams.
