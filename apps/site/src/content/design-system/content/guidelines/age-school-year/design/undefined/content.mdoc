Use numerals, not words.

For example:

> Do: 18
> 
> Don’t: eighteen

For individuals, use ‘years old’ or ‘year old’, depending on the context. For groups, use ‘year olds’.

For example:

> If you’re under 30 years old…
> 
> We asked an 18 year old…
> 
> We asked a group of 18 year olds…

*Note: Don’t use hyphens.*

For school years, capitalise the ‘Y’

For example:

> Year 12 students
