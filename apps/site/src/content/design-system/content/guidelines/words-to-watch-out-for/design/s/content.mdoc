**Sorry**&nbsp;can be an admission that we've done the wrong thing, so use it carefully. Use it only if the message that we're communicating would sound abrupt or rude without it.

For example:

> Do: You’ve reached the maximum number of applications.
> 
> Don’t: Sorry, you’ve reached the maximum number of applications.
