States and territories have each word capitalised.

For example:

> Australian Capital Territory (ACT)
> 
> New South Wales (NSW)
> 
> Victoria (Vic)
> 
> Queensland (Qld)
> 
> Western Australia (WA)
> 
> South Australia (SA)
> 
> Tasmania (Tas)
> 
> Northern Territory (NT)

*Note: Donâ€™t use all-caps for Vic, Qld, Tas as they are the shortened versions of each full name of the state, rather than each letter representing a word, e.g., NSW stands for New South Wales.*
