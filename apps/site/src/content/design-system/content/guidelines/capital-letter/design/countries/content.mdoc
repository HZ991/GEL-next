Take note of the way we refer to certain countries.

China – use China, not PRC

United Kingdom - use UK or United Kingdom, not England or Great Britain

United States - use US or United States, not USA, America or United States of America.

*Note: For H1 headings, US reads as ‘us’, so use U.S.*

For example:

> China trade deal
> 
> UK stock market recovery
> 
> US stocks hit a slump
> 
> INVEST IN U.S. STOCKS
