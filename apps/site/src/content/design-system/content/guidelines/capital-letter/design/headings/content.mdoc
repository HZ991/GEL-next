Headings always use sentence-case (not title-case), excluding H1 page headings which are all-caps.

For example:

> Do: Get $3k cashback when you refinance to us
>
> Don’t: Get $3K Cashback When You Refinance To Us

_Note: No full stops on the end of any headings – see_ [_Headings and subheadings_](/design-system/content/headings-subheadings)_._
