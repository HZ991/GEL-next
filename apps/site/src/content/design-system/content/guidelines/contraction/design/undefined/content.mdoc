Our writing style is conversational, so use contractions wherever possible.

For example:

> Do: You’ll, you’re, don’t, aren’t
>
> Don’t: You will, you are, do not, are not

---

Don’t use unnatural sounding contractions.

For example:

> Don’t: May’ve, wouldn’t’ve, where’d

_Note: There are instances where contractions cannot be used for legal reasons._
