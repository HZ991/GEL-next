Use normal punctuation in brackets.

For example:

> Set up direct debit payments for regular bills (e.g. phone, water and electricity), to stay on top of your finances.

---

Ensure the sentence still makes sense with the bracketed copy removed.

For example:

> Set up direct debit payments for regular bills, to stay on top of your finances.
