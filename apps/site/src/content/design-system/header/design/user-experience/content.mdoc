Headers provide a reliable place to house navigation and, when required, access to other key features, ie Sign in/out. The brand identity is not only used for recognition, but serves as a ‘home’ button when the user needs an ‘escape’ from whatever environment they are in. At the smaller breakpoints the header also houses access to the Menu.&nbsp;
