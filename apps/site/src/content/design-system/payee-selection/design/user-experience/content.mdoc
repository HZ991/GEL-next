Payee information can be laid out differently, depending the payee type. The visual hierarchy of the information ensures the most important detail is easily found. Each account can contain the following elements:

- **Logo, initials or icon**&nbsp;- this visually indicates the type of payee, allowing the user to quickly scan the list to locate the payee they are looking for.
- **Payee name**&nbsp;- By default, this is the payee's account name. However, if the customer has created a nickname for the payee, it may be shown instead. Using the nickname when itâ€™s available helps the customer recognise which payee is being shown - if the customer has multiple payees of the same type, this makes it easier to distinguish them.
- **Account details/BPay details**&nbsp;- The BSB, account number, Biller code & reference number is displayed depending on the payee type.
- **Info button** - The info icon button is displayed in online baking scenarios where   a dual link action is required, the payee name selects the payee and the info icon button allows to user to go to a new page showing all the details for that particular payee.
- **Date** - when a date is displayed is to reference the last time that payee was paid, it is usually reserved for those payees that have been recently paid.
