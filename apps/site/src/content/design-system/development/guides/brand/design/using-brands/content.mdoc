Add a custom attribute tag `data-theme="brand_name"` to the base `html` tag. Note that instead of adding the custom attribute to the html tag, you can add it to the parent tag of your application as well.

The following example shows adding the `wbc` theme. You can add other valid brand names such as `stg`, `bom`, `bsa`, `rams`, `wbg` etc. as the value.

```html
<StaticCode language="jsx" code={`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en" data-theme="wbc">
    ...
    </html>
`} />
```
