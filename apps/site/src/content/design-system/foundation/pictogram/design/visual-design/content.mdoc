The pictogram sets were created in accordance with the latest brand guidelines. The visual language needs to be as clear and concise as the metaphor otherwise the intent is lost.

Care has been taken to design these with a small degree of depth, while establishing a visual language which can be replicated.

For production, they have all been created in a centred, square format to suit as many use cases as possible (text left, right, and below). For details on how to design and deliver a pictogram ready for production, contact the GEL team.
