Pictograms are wonderful devices that can help sighted users understand a product or piece of communication faster while added a degree of brand recognition and recall.

All pictograms have a defined, associated metaphor to ensure they consistently embody and communicate the right meaning to customers across all digital touch-points. Therefore itâ€™s important to understand which pictogram to use when and where by referencing the Pictogram metaphor list, you can find this with the other [pictogram process documents](https://westpacgroup.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/O365-UG-043642/EuPcpzS5tBBCr6-R9P_FK7ABLKbHiBdxhL2-HW2uUlwShw) (this is a secure link).

When using Informative pictograms, consider whether or not an icon would better serve the purpose, particularly for task based functions.

As Decorative pictograms are so vibrant, their use needs to be carefully considered as they could overwhelm the page, screen, or experience. Typically, they can draw attention to a product, enhance brand presence on the screen, celebrate a milestone or moment, and do not require accompanying text.
