- A `<svg>` element labeled with a description identifies the Logo
- The Logo shape is visible in Windows High Contrast Mode
- When using alongside descriptive visual text ensure `aria-hidden="true"` is used to hide the Logo from assistive technologies, otherwise users will receive duplicate descriptions

**Accessibility in the HTML**

- `<svg aria-label="{DESCRIPTION}">`: Provides a label that describes the Logo
- `<svg role="img" focusable="false">`: Prevents the Logo SVG element from being traversed by browsers that map the SVG to the ‘group’ role and from unnecessarily receiving focus in Internet Explorer (IE)
