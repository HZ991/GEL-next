Logos are one part of a greater brand identity. Their usage has guidelines which are designed to protect the integrity of the mark and ultimately trust in the brand.

It is therefore important to consider where, when, and how often a brand logo is used. It can help build trust with a consumer when using an application or webpage, and specifically in digital depending on the location (usually at the top left) and can be a recognised affordance for the applicationâ€™s home.
