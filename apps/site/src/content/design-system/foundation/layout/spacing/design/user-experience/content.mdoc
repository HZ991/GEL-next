Spacing tokens help maintain consistency and visual harmony in design systems. They are used to create consistent margins, padding, and distances between various elements within a user interface. By using spacing tokens, designers can establish a systematic approach to spacing, ensuring a cohesive and organised layout across different components. This not only enhances the overall aesthetic appeal but also streamlines the development process by providing a standardised set of spacing values that can be easily applied and adjusted throughout a project.

This image shows where you will find margin, padding and gap spacing.
