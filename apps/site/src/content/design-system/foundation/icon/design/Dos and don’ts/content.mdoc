*   Do create additional icons if required. See article below for more information.
*   Avoid using UI icons as page embellishment this is not what they are intended for.
*   Do not outline the UI icons. This is not how they were designed to display.
*   Avoid using icons at any other sizes as this will force them off the pixel grid and could reduce legibility.
*   Always use labels with UI icons unless the icon is a globally recognised symbol.
*   Avoid using too many icons. This adds unnecessary clutter to the interface.
