All the icons in this library have been designed and crafted on a 24px grid, allowing them to be used at the pre-defined sizes below. This ensures that horizontal and vertical edges align with the pixel grid, with the exception of the Small (18px). Resulting in a sharper more legible graphic. If icons are not used at these intended sizes they will no longer align to the pixel grid which will result in a blurred effect. Using a fixed set of icon sizes also helps maintain consistency across all our applications.
