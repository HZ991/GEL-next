The UI icon library is intended for use across all our brands and user interfaces.

Simplicity is the key design requirement for UI icons. Each icon in the library is reduced to its minimal form, just enough to capture the essence of its meaning. This ensures readability and clarity even at small sizes. It also optimises the vector file size by limiting the number of points required to draw the graphic.

Icons are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVGs) with PNG fallbacks for older browsers. Using SVGs ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows them to be styled dynamically using code and complies with AA accessibility requirements.
