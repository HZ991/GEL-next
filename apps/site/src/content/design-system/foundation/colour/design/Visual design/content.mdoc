Each brand in the Westpac Group uses a unique colour palette as part of its identity. These colours permeate across every touchpoint in the customer journey. Each brand's colour palette is mapped to the core UI palette and uses variables (tokens) to identify the colour. This allows brands to be switched quickly, efficiently and accurately. Correct use of the core colours plays a crucial role in brand recognition, customer experience, accessibility and consistency. When the colour palette is not applied correctly the integrity of the brand is diluted and the customer journey fragmented. When using colour, make sure you are using approved brand colours.
