The secondary palette is a collection of bespoke, brand specific colours. Unlike the primary palette secondary colours do not map to the other brands. Secondary colours are generally used for bespoke brand embellishment: headers, promos, charts, diagrams etc. They are unique to the brand and must not be used anywhere else.
