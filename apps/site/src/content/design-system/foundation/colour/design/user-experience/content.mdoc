Colour can impact a design greatly by influencing decision making or undermining design intent. Bold colours can draw attention but design with too many bold colours and it will have the opposite result.

When using colour careful consideration needs to be centred around a number of aspects such as the use of brand colours, how colour may be perceived for certain tasks, how colours interact with one another (discord, analogous, complementary), and how colour is impacted by accessibility requirements.

The colour palette available is dictated by the brand, with accessibility an increasingly important factor.
