The data visualisation colour palette gives each brand a set of 6 colours (A-F). Each colour has a corresponding 50% tint and 30% opacity. This set of 18 colours provides enormous scope and flexibility for a wide range of complex data visualisations. The first 4 colours (A–D) are the main set and should ALWAYS be the first choice. The last 2 colours (E–F) are backup colours and must ONLY be used as a last resort for charts that require more than 4 categories. These colours are reserved and must only be used for Data Visualisation (charts and graphs).
