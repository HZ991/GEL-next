*   When colouring SVGs ensure paths use the actual fill colour (hex) values if colour is detrimental to understanding the interface. The _currentColor_ value does not render colour in Windows High Contrast Mode (WHCM). Colour is also not rendered as _background-color_ on elements in WHCM.
*   Borders, text and outlines of any colour render as white in WHCM. Using transparent borders can provide a simple and elegant way to render shapes in WHCM (e.g. to add a shape change for an active menu item).
