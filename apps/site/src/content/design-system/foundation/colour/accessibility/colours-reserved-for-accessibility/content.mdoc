The Design System has two colours in its palette that can only be used by the system to ensure components are accessible, each of them has a specific purpose - these are not colours that can be used in design:

- **Border Dark**&nbsp;was created to be used for the outline of form elements and other controls, ie text inputs, radios etc. This colour was darkened to comply with the accessibility guidelines requiring a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. The original Border colour was kept for use in other areas of design as the use of the darkened colour in all areas of the interface would have not been on brand.
- **Focus**&nbsp;is used for the keyboard focus indicator. This is a feature that most browsers provide, however the way it is provided is rarely accessible. This colour, with the compliant contrast ratio of 3:1, was added to the Design System to override the default browser keyboard focus colour.
