Use the editorial text styles to draw attention to aspects of your content. The styles below map to the current HTML text styling tags. Where possible we recommend using HTML semantic elements as they clearly describe the meaning of the content to the browser and the developer. This will also maximise the opportunity to provide accessible content.
