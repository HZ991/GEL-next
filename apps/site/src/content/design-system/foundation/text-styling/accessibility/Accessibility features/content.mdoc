- Text links are styled with a custom colour to distinguish them from normal text, but also use the standard HTML document underline convention. This approach satisfies an important accessibility requirement to ‘not rely on colour alone’ to convey information, indicate an action or distinguish a visual element.
- An indicator outline appears around the links when focused
- Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- All content (including links) is visible in Windows High Contrast Mode
