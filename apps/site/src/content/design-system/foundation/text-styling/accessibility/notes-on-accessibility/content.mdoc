All components comply with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines and Success Criteria. These fall under the [four principles of accessibility](/design-system/wbc/accessibility/design-system-accessibility) â€“ Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust. Below are some specific ways in which this component follows these principles:

### Perceivable

*Body font size:* 14px is the recommended minimum size for body text. Smaller sizes are sometimes used for labels in Native mobile apps however it is not recommended to use text sizing below 14px for body or UI elements. It is a legal requirement that all terms and conditions text is the same size as the body text. So, as well as being an accessibility requirement, it is also a Group legal and compliance requirement.

*Link styling:* It is an accessibility requirement for links to be defined using both colour and shape, the link style is underlined and Primary coloured. A chevron is used when displaying a [list](/design-system/wbc/components/lists) of links, when using links in a menu or navigation system it is not necessary for each item to be underlined.
