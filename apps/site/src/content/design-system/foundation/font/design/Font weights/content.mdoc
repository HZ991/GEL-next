The typography system uses numerical values to assign different font weights rather than specifying the physical name or weight of the font. For example, assigning a value of 300 to the font weight property will display the light weight (providing Itâ€™s available). Unavailable weights display the logically closest weight. Font weights should always be used in alignment with the GUI and the digital brand guidelines.

_**Note:**_ _Do not use 300 (light) on text sizes below 18px or your text may fall out of an accessible colour contrast range._
