All components comply with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines and Success Criteria. These fall under the [four principles of accessibility](/accessibility/design-system-accessibility) – Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust. Below are some specific ways in which this component follows these principles:

### Perceivable

Do not use 300 (light) on text sizes below 18px or your text may fall out of an accessible colour contrast range.

### Understandable

Be careful with the use of ALL CAPS, it can be difficult for users to scan large amounts of ALL CAPS text. In some cases screen readers will announce ALL CAPS as ‘shouting’, and some small words, like AND, GO or THE may be announced as acronyms.
