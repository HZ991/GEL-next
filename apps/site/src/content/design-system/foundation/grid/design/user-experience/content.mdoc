The grid is the core ingredient for developing consistent, robust, responsive applications. Itâ€™s designed to work seamlessly on the ever-increasing plethora of screen sizes and resolutions.

All projects should be designed and built using the 12 column grid. Responsive content, ie the same content re-organised to be usable on all screen sizes, is important for user engagement. Having a consistent experience across all devices, being able to start a process on one device and complete it on another with consistent and reliable content keeps users confident, engaged and builds trust.
