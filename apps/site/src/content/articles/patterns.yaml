  UX and UI patterns, are recurring design solutions and best practices that
  address common problems and challenges in user interface and interaction
  design. These patterns have evolved over time as our designers and researchers
  have identified effective ways to enhance the user experience and solve
  specific usability issues. Our patterns serve as guidelines and templates for
  designing user interfaces, making it easier for projects to create intuitive
  and consistent designs that contribute to a more cohesive customer experience
  across our entire digital channel.
