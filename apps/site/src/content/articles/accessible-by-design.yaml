  Let’s change the way we think about accessibility. Westpac’s Access and
  Inclusion Director, Majella Knobel notes “People assume accessibility is only
  about the 18% of people with disability. But everyone, to some extent, will
  experience what it’s like to live with disability. It could be a change in
  eyesight, an injured wrist or a recovery from surgery. Disability and
  accessibility requirements will impact all of us at some point in our
  lifetime.”
